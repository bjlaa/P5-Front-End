Project 5: Neighbourhood Map // Front-End Web Developper 
(UDACITY NANODEGREE):

This project presents a map of my town, Berlin, with a list of some of my favourite places.

- to select a place click on the location on the list or click on the marker chosen on the map

- to search for a place in the list, type in the name of the location searched in the search bar on the top right

- when a marker is selected (by clicking on it in the list or on the map) an info window opens with its title and a picture of the location


This project has been made by combining the Google Maps API and the Wikipedia API (to retrieve the images).
